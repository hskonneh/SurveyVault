**M**any people want to learn how to programme ODK tools, XLS Forms used for Kobo Collect but has few resources to accomplish that.<br/>
There is also a great community :point_right: [community.kobotoolbox](https://community.kobotoolbox.org/) that can help learners of kobo toolbox to proceed in their learning journey.<br/>
One of the problems I faced in my journey of kobo toolbox is that I wasn't previewed to sample XLS Forms that I can learn from, hence limiting my capacity to function only with the web UI tool.
